About this talk
====================

    If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must
    be the process of putting them in.

    (Dykstra's Observation)

|pause|

- 80% of development is spent in debugging

- 80% of debugging is spent in **finding** the bugs

  * Bug hunting!

|pause|

- No silver bullet

- The mindset of the bug hunter

- Examples of techniques I use


What is a bug?
===============

- (Un)expected behaviour of a program

  * Crash

  * Incorrect result
  
  * Memory leak

  * Performance problem

|pause|

- Categories

  * Deterministic

  * Undeterministic

  * Heisenbugs


Scenario
=========

- Big project

- Lot of code, lots of people, several years of development

- Complex relations in the source code (e.g. PyPy :))

|pause|

- VPBR (Very Precise Bug Report)

  * `"the program does not work!"`

|pause|

- "Big", "lot" and "complex" are subjective

- There will always be a level of complexity which you can't understand
  immediately.

NaÃ¯ve approach
======================

* Guess where is the problem

* Locate the related source code

* Repeat:

  - try to understand the mess of the source code

  - (optional: inspect in a debugger)

  - fix&try

|pause|

* Very fast if the bug is simple

* Little chance of success if the bug is complex

  - The world stop to make any sense

Mindset
=======

- There MUST be an explanation

- No divinity or god is against you

- Your assumptions might be wrong

- The compiler/library/O.S. is probably correct |pause|

  * Unless it's not :)




General approach
=================

|scriptsize| (not necessarily in this order) |end_scriptsize|

|small|


0. (from the Zen of Python): Refuse the temptation to guess

1. Reproduce the bug

2. Automatize the run (you are going to run it **many** times)

3. Find the smallest test case which fails

4. Spot the problem. 

5. Understand the problem

6. **Make predictions**, run, repeat. Fixed.

- Goal: Understand, **then** fix

|end_small|



1. Reproduce the bug
=====================

- Might be tricky sometimes

- Try to reproduce it locally

  * "but it works on my machine!"

- Write a test

|pause|

- Pay attention to all the possible variables

  * Operating System

  * Version of program&libraries

  * CPU, 32/64 bit

  * Workload, RAM size

  * Network latency/bandwith

  * Localization

  * Phase of the moon

  * ..., plus any combination of the above


2. Automation
===============

- "One click away bugs"

- Avoid manual input from the user

- Example: GUI with a "load" button

  * --> small program to call the event handler directly

- Example: web application

  * --> small program which sends the "right" HTTP requests

- At worst: mouse automation (autopy, pywinauto)

- Write a test

3. Reduction
=============

- Goal: smallest possible program which still fail

- Example: crash in an HTML parser

- Reduce the data

  * Remove some of the tags of the offending HTML document

  * Check whether it still fails

  * Repeat

- Reduce the code

  * Remove the code for handling malformed HTML

  * If it still fails, the problem is somewhere else

  * If it stops failing, the problem is there 

- Write a test

4. Spot the problem
========================

- Bigger reduction --> easier hunting

- If it's still too complex

  - step by step in a debugger

  - print/logging/tracing

  - strace, ltrace

5-6. Understand & fix
=====================

- Refuse the temptation to guess

- Fix only **after** you understood the problem

- Make predictions

  * (a.k.a: "the scientific method", G. Galilei, 1638 ca)

  * Make a change

  * Have precise expectations on the output

  * Verify

- The mind adapt its view of the world to what you observe.

- **Write a test** (if you didn't yet)

  * Almost for free once you have reduced&automated

  * Fail before, pass after the fix

Excursus: benefits of TDD (1)
===============================

- Write a (failing) test before implementing a feature

- Write a (failing) test before fixing a bug

- Check you didn't introduce any other bug: rerun the entire testsuite

- Commit!

- Regression: "something stopped working"

- A test fails, but used to pass

Excursus: benefits of TDD(2)
==============================

|small|

1. ``hg bisect --reset; hg bisect --bad``

2. ``hg up -r some-rev-where-the-test-passed``

3. check whether the test passes

  * ``hg bisect --good`` OR

  * ``hg bisect --bad``

4. goto 3

|pause|

* OR: ``hg bisect -c py.test test_myfile.py -k my_failing_test``

* ``git bisect`` works similarly

|end_small|

Real world example
===================

- PyPy ``_fastjson`` decoder

- "Large" document crashes in the middle

- "Simple&fast" approach

  * Locate the error message

  * Look around, put a pdb, try to guess

  * No way

|pause|

- "General approach"

  * Reduce the data!

  * Write a test

  * (fix)



Don't assume the assumptions
=============================

  When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however
  improbable, must be the truth (Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "The
  Sign of Four")

* Be prepared to question everything

* Challenge your assumptions

  - put a ``print`` to make sure a function is called

  - put ``assert`` everywhere

  - write passing tests to check that the world behave as you expect

  - make sure you are editing the right file!

The "XXX" technique
====================

- Your fix some code, but the system ignores you

- Put an ``XXX`` in the code and check that it breaks

- .pyc files

- the module is imported from somewhere else:

  * a different checkout

  * site-packages/ vs your development dir

- two functions with the same name

- ``print __file__``

- ``print mymodule.__file__``

- ``print myfunction.__module__``




Useful tools
============

- Debuggers:

  - ``pdb``, ``pdb++``, ``pudb``, ``ipdb``

  - ``pip install pdbpp`` (unix-only, sorry)

  - IDE debuggers (PyCharm, Wing IDE, etc.)

- Breakpoints and step-by-step execution

  - ``import pdb;pdb.set_trace()``


Post-mortem debugging
======================

- ``py.test --pdb test_myprogram.py``

- ``python -m pdb myprogram.py``

|pause|

|scriptsize|
|example<| |small| Automatic post-mortem pdb |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python

    import sys
    import traceback
    import pdb

    def start_pdb(type, value, tb):
        traceback.print_exception(type, value, tb)
        print
        pdb.pm()

    sys.excepthook = start_pdb

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|

Eaten exceptions (1)
=====================

- Exceptions caugth before they reach you

- No chance to enter post-mortem

  * because there is no mortem :)

- E.g.: logging

|scriptsize|
|example<| |small| somewhere deep in the code... |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python

   try:
       do_something()
   except Exception, e:
       logfile.write('An error occoured: %s' % e)

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|

Eaten exceptions (2)
=====================

|scriptsize|
|example<| |small| somewhere deep in the code... |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python
   
   try:
       do_something()
   except Exception, e:
       # this will open a pdb at the point where 
       # the exceptions was originally raised
       pdb.post_mortem(sys.exc_info()[2])
       logfile.write('An error occoured: %s' % e)

|end_example|

|pause|
|example<| |small| with pdb++ |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python
   
   try:
       do_something()
   except Exception, e:
       # equivalent to the above
       pdb.xpm()
       logfile.write('An error occoured: %s' % e)

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|


Eaten exceptions (3)
=====================

- Don't eat exceptions unless you really have to

|small|
|alert<| |small| NEVER do it |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python
   
   try:
       do_something()
   except:
       pass

|end_alert|
|end_small|


Logging/tracing vs manual step-by-step
======================================

- sometimes step-by-step is not always applicable

  * |scriptsize| http://antocuni.eu/misc/tracker.txt |end_scriptsize|

|column1|

|scriptsize|
|example<| |small| Trace calls |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python

   call = CallTracker()

   @call.track
   def foo(x, y):
       return bar(x) + baz(y)

   @call.track
   def bar(a):
       call.log('a ==', a)
       return a*2

   @call.track
   def baz(b):
       return b*3

   print foo(10, 20)

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|

|pause|
|column2|

|tiny|
|example<| |small| Trace calls |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python

    class CallTracker(object):
        def __init__(self):     
            self.level = 0

        def log(self, *args):
            print('   ' * self.level, *args)

        def exit(self, f):
            self.level -= 1

        def enter(self, f):
            self.log('entering', f)
            self.level += 1

        def track(self, fn):
            def newfn(*args, **kwds):
                self.enter(fn.__name__)
                try:
                    return fn(*args, **kwds)
                finally:
                    self.exit(fn.__name__)
            return newfn

|end_example|
|end_tiny|

|end_columns|



Conditional breakpoints
========================

.. sourcecode:: python

  if something:
     import pdb;pdb.set_trace()

* During the debugging you are allowed to cheat:

  - E.g.: check whether a string containing "foobar" is in a list

  - ``if "foobar" in repr(myobj)``

* Combine it with logging

* E.g.: stop only just before the crash

* _fastjson demo


Exploit Python dynamicity (1)
=============================

|scriptsize|
|example<| |small| pdb on setattr |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python

   class Foo(object):

       def __setattr__(self, name, value):
           if name == 'x' and value == 42:
               import pdb;pdb.set_trace()
           object.__setattr__(self, name, value)

   f = Foo()
   f.y = 123
   f.x = 456
   f.x = 42 # PDB!


|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|

Exploit Python dynamicity (2)
=============================

|scriptsize|
|example<| |small| using pdb++ |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python

   import pdb # this is actually pdb++

   def is_42(obj, value):
       return value == 42

   @pdb.break_on_setattr('x', condition=is_42)
   class Foo(object):
       pass

   f = Foo()
   f.y = 123
   f.x = 456
   f.x = 42 # PDB!

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|


Exploit Python dynamicity (3)
=============================

* Real world example

* Where the hell is the Django code to locate a template?!?

|scriptsize|
|example<| |small| break on file open |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python

    import __builtin__

    original_open = open
    def myopen(filename, *args):
        if 'passwd' in filename:
            import pdb;pdb.set_trace()
        return original_open(filename, *args)

    __builtin__.open = myopen
    __builtin__.file = myopen

    print open(__file__).read()
    print open('/etc/passwd').read()

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|

Exploit Python dynamicity (4)
=============================

* Useful when you don't know/find who prints a certain message

|scriptsize|
|example<| |small| break on stdout |end_small| |>|

.. sourcecode:: python

    import sys

    class MyStdout(object):
        def __init__(self, out):
            self.out = out

        def write(self, s):
            if 'i == 100' in s:
                import pdb;pdb.set_trace()
            self.out.write(s)

    sys.stdout = MyStdout(sys.stdout)

    for i in range(200):
        print 'i == %d' % i

|end_example|
|end_scriptsize|


Non-deterministic bugs (1)
===========================

- The bug does not show always

- Might depend on the phase of the moon

- In C: unitialized memory, freed pointers, etc.

- Much less common in Python

|pause|

- Dictionary order

- C extensions

- ctypes, cffi & co.

- Threading, race conditions

Non-deterministic bugs (2)
==========================

- You cannot be sure to have solved the problem

- Key: make it deterministic

  * Run it N times (remember automation?)

  * Use a larger input

  * Try to change the conditions (e.g. free memory, CPU load)

  * Put random sleeps/busy loops in the threads

  * Allocate N big objects at the start

- Exploit low level tools

  * gdb watch

  * valgrind

Heisenbugs
===========

- The program crashes

- As soon as you modify for inspection, it works 

- Yes, some divinity might be against you

|pause|

- Leaving it modified is NOT the solution! :)

- Inspect without modify

  * use print/logging instead of pdb.set_trace()

  * inspect from gdb

  * strace, ltrace

- No general solution, sorry :-(
