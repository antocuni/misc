Bug Hunting for Dummies
========================

Debugging is one of the most time consuming phases of developing. For a large
category of problems, fixing the bug is easy once you find it. The hard part
is to spot the right (well, wrong) place in the code.

This talk presents a series of techniques of suggestions on how to make your
debugging sessions more effective, including: - exploit the full power of Test
Driven Development - make your bug repeatable - bisect the code and/or the
data - “Python dirty tricks” - how to handle non-deterministic bugs and
heisenbugs
