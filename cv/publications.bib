	abstract = {We attempt to apply the technique of Tracing {JIT} Compilers in the context of the {PyPy} project, i.e., to programs that are interpreters for some dynamic languages, including Python. Tracing {JIT} compilers can greatly speed up programs that spend most of their time in loops in which they take similar code paths. However, applying an unmodified tracing {JIT} to a program that is itself a bytecode interpreter results in very limited or no speedup. In this paper we show how to guide tracing {JIT} compilers to greatly improve the speed of bytecode interpreters. One crucial point is to unroll the bytecode dispatch loop, based on two kinds of hints provided by the implementer of the bytecode interpreter. We evaluate our technique by applying it to two {PyPy} interpreters: one is a small example, and the other one is the full Python interpreter.},

    abstract = {Although the C-based interpreter of Python is reasonably fast, implementations on the {CLI} or the {JVM} platforms offers some advantages in terms of robustness and interoperability. Unfortunately, because the {CLI} and {JVM} are primarily designed to execute statically typed, object-oriented languages, most dynamic language implementations cannot use the native bytecodes for common operations like method calls and exception handling; as a result, they are not able to take full advantage of the power offered by the {CLI} and {JVM.}},
